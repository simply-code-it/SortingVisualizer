### Sorting Algorithms Visualization Project Documentation

### Overview
This project aims to showcase the real-time working of various sorting algorithms using React. By visualizing these algorithms, users can better understand how each sorting technique operates and how they compare to each other in terms of efficiency and performance.

### Project Features
Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms.
Support for various sorting algorithms including:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Adjustable array size and sorting speed for experimentation and learning.
Clear visualization of the sorting process step by step.

### Technologies Used
React: Utilized for building the user interface and managing the state of the application.

JavaScript: Implemented the sorting algorithms logic.
HTML/CSS: Styled and structured the user interface for better user experience.

### Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:
cd sorting-algorithms-visualization

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm start

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the project.


### Usage
Upon loading the project, you will see an array of bars representing unsorted elements.

Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Adjust the array size and sorting speed sliders if needed.

Click the "Sort" button to begin the visualization of the selected sorting algorithm.

Watch as the bars move and rearrange themselves according to the sorting algorithm.

Once sorting is complete, the bars will be displayed in sorted order.

### Deployment
